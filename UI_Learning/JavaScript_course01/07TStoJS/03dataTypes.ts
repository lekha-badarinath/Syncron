//declaring datatypes in typeScript

//declaring variables like this is to make sure that in future, a particular variable can contain only a specific type of data.
let a: number;
let b: string;
let c: boolean;
let d: any;
let e: number[]; //will declare an array which can have only numbers
let f: any[] = [1,'a',true] ;  //will declare an array which can have any type of data
