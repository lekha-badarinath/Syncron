//declaring datatypes in typeScript
//declaring variables like this is to make sure that in future, a particular variable can contain only a specific type of data.
var a;
var b;
var c;
var d;
var e; //will declare an array which can have only numbers
var f = [1, 'a', true]; //will declare an array which can have any type of data
